# AMOLED Power Consumption Test Example

Source path: example/pm/amoled

### Supported Development Boards
This example can run on the following development boards:
- sf32lb52-core_n16r16

## Overview
Under the RT-Thread operating system, two modes are set: one is the screen-off mode (screen turns off and enters sleep after 5s of screen refresh); the other is the always-on screen mode (screen remains on and then enters sleep after 5s of screen refresh). Switching between these two modes can be done through finsh commands, where `power_mode 1` (switch from screen-off mode to always-on screen mode), `power_mode 0` (switch from always-on screen mode to screen-off mode).

> Note: Mode switching can only be successful during the wake-up phase. Mode switching during the sleep phase will not take effect.

### Mode Introduction
* Three screen modes

* 1. Power Off Mode: In this mode, most of the internal circuits of the screen are turned off. The screen will be completely black and will not display any images. Internal power circuits, driver ICs, backlight (for LCD) or pixels (for OLED) will stop working.

* 2. Idle Mode: The purpose is to minimize power consumption while maintaining basic functions, so as to quickly resume normal operation. The screen usually stops refreshing and maintains the static image of the last frame before entering Idle mode (but some screens may clear the display). Core display drivers and memory (such as GRAM) remain powered, but clocks and scanning circuits may stop or significantly reduce frequency.

* 3. Normal Mode: This is the full-function working mode of the screen with the highest power consumption. The screen refreshes normally and continuously, dynamically displaying image data sent from the host. All internal circuits, including clock generators, scanning drivers, GRAM, gamma correction circuits, and power circuits, operate at full speed.

* Always-on screen mode and screen-off mode in project introduction

1. Always-on screen mode: Refers to the screen's working state being refreshed in Normal Mode. After refreshing, the chip module enters Idle Mode, but the screen does not enter sleep mode.

2. Screen-off mode: The screen's working state is refreshed in Normal Mode. After refreshing, the screen first enters Power Off Mode, then the chip module enters sleep.

## Hardware Connection
For low power consumption testing, the board is no longer powered through USB but needs to be powered through a power consumption testing tool to the board's VCC_5V with 5V power supply. Therefore, the following operations need to be performed to conduct power consumption testing.

* Original power supply situation of development board
![alt text](assets/core_board.png)

* Remove all jumper caps except for ADDIO, PVDD, and AVDD
![alt text](assets/remove_jumper_cap.png)

* Connect the power consumption testing tool's VOUT to the board's VCC_5V, and connect GND to the PPK's GND pin
![alt text](assets/PPK_connect.png)

* For convenient debugging, the UART converter can be connected to the board's TX and RX

* Final connection

## menuconfig Configuration
The required configurations are already enabled by default.

```c
menuconfig --board=board_name
```

1. Enable low power mode
- Path: Sifli middleware 
    - Enable: Enable low power support
        - Macro switch: `CONFIG_BSP_USING_PM`
        - Function: Enable low power

2. Enable output of low power related logs (disabled by default to reduce power consumption. Can be enabled in menuconfig for debugging and verification)
- Path: SiFli Middleware → Enable Low Power Support
    - Enable: Enable PM Debug
    - Macro switch: `CONFIG_BSP_PM_DEBUG`
    - Function: Output low power related logs

### Compilation and Flashing

## Power Consumption Test Results
* We use a 200mAh battery capacity as an example to test the above two modes and estimate device usage time.
* Classified into light, medium, and heavy usage scenarios, corresponding to 100, 300, and 500 wake-up times respectively. Each wake-up executes 5 seconds of screen refresh to simulate the time people spend viewing content.

### Screen-off Mode

1. Key trigger wake-up (used to simulate watching time on a watch)
* Average current during 5s screen refresh after key wake-up: 12.48mA
![alt text](assets/lcd_on_wakeup_ppk.png)

* Power consumption per day
   - 100 times: 12.48*100*5/3600 = 1.73 (mAh)
   - 300 times: 12.48*300*5/3600 = 5.2 (mAh) 
   - 500 times: 12.48*500*5/3600 = 8.65 (mAh)

2. Screen-off sleep (used to simulate standby state)
* Quiescent current in screen-off sleep mode: 49.06uA
![alt text](assets/lcd_off_sleep_ppk.png)

* Power required for one hour of screen-off sleep
    49.6/1000*1=0.0496 (mAh)

* Total daily consumption calculated as:
   - 100 times: 0.0496 * (24 * 3600 - 100 * 5) + 1.73 = 2.91 (mAh)  
   - 300 times: 0.0496 * (24 * 3600 - 300 * 5) + 5.20 = 6.37 (mAh)
   - 500 times: 0.0496 * (24 * 3600 - 500 * 5) + 8.65 = 9.81 (mAh)



### Always-on Screen Mode

1. Key trigger wake-up (used to simulate watch usage)
* Average current required for 5s screen refresh after key wake-up: 12.38mA
![alt text](assets/lcd_wakeup_ppk.png)

* Power consumption during usage
   - 100 times: 12.48*100*5/3600 = 1.73 (mAh)
   - 300 times: 12.48*300*5/3600 = 5.2 (mAh)
   - 500 times: 12.48*500*5/3600 = 8.65 (mAh)

2. Always-on screen sleep (used to simulate always-on screen standby state)
* Quiescent current in always-on screen sleep mode: 5.7mA
![alt text](assets/lcd_sleep_ppk.png)
* Power consumption required for one hour of screen-on sleep
    5.7*1=5.7 (mAh)

* Daily consumption
   - 100 times: 5.7*(24*3600-100*5) + 1.73 = 137.73 (mAh)
   - 300 times: 5.7*(24*3600-300*5) + 5.20 = 139.63 (mAh)
   - 500 times: 5.7*(24*3600-500*5) + 8.65 = 141.5 (mAh)


## Abnormal Diagnosis
If the measured results differ significantly from those in the document, there may be abnormalities. Please conduct troubleshooting on your own.
UDDIO: Chip IO power supply
PVDD: Chip main power input
AVDD: Chip audio

1. If there are hardware modifications, it may cause significant deviations in test results
2. Mismatch between power supply voltage and required voltage will also cause significant deviations in test results (using 5V power supply)

* Troubleshooting steps: The original 5V power supply can be unplugged, and the jumper caps of UDDIO, PVDD, and AVDD can be removed. The above three paths can be powered individually using the power consumption testing tool, and the remaining two paths can be powered through external VCC. This allows for single-path power consumption testing to identify which power path has abnormalities (note that VCC_3V3 needs to be powered separately as it powers the screen alone).
